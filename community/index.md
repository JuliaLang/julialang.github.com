Please take a moment to read the [Julia Community Standards](standards/). We
expect that your participation in any Julia related forum, online or offline,
respects these standards.

## Official Channels

### GitHub

We use GitHub for the development of Julia itself. There we host our source
code, track [issues](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues), and accept
[pull requests](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pulls). We use the issue
tracker for bug reports, feature requests, and proposed changes. For support and
questions, please use Discourse.

### Discourse

The primary online discussion venue for Julia is the [Discourse
forum](https://discourse.julialang.org/). Discourse is the right place to do any
of the following:
- **Keep up to date** on important Julia announcements like language releases
  and JuliaCon.
- **Ask a question** about any aspect of using or developing Julia or its
  associated packages and tools. The Discourse forum is the best place to get a
  fast, high-quality answer to your Julia question. There are subcategories for
  various Julia application domains such as machine learning, finance,
  visualisation and GPUs. Questions from newcomers are always welcome: you can
  use the "first steps" tag to highlight your question as one that would benefit
  other new users.
- **Respond to others' questions**: our community thrives when people share
  their knowledge and experience.
- **Announce a new package** or solicit feedback about something you have been
  developing.
- **Advertise** Julia-related jobs and community events.

The Discourse forum replaced the Julia mailing lists, the largest of which were
[julia-users](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/julia-users) and
[julia-dev](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/julia-dev), at the end
of 2016. Those lists are now read-only but you may like to search them to see if
your question has already been raised.

### Slack

For casual conversation and quick, informal questions, we have an [official
Julia Slack](https://julialang.slack.com). Slack is also a good place to start
if you think you need help but aren't quite sure what you should be asking or
where to ask it. To join, please visit
[slackinvite.julialang.org](https://slackinvite.julialang.org/) to agree to the
community code of conduct and receive an invitation.

### YouTube

All the [JuliaCon](http://juliacon.org) videos and other videos of general
interest in the community are uploaded to the [Julia Language YouTube
channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/JuliaLanguage).


## Other channels

On Twitter, tweet with the
[#julialang](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23julialang) hashtag.

Julia also has a presence on Stack Overflow under the
[julia-lang](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/julia-lang) tag, and on
Stack Overflow en Espa√±ol under
[julia](http://es.stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/julia).

For those who prefer IRC to our official forums, there is a [#julia
channel](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=julia) on Freenode. We also have
an unofficial [Gitter](https://gitter.im/JuliaLang/julia) channel.

There is a small [Julia subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Julia/) for casual
discussion.


## International Community

The Julia community is global, with meetups all over the world and resources in
a variety of different languages.

### Localization

Julia's official documentation is in English, but many groups work to translate
and localize documentation and other resources. A few such groups that are
leading these efforts include:

* [JuliaTokyo](http://julia.tokyo) (Japanese)
* [JulialangOrgCN](http://julialang.org.cn) (Chinese Simplified)
* [JuliaLangEs](https://github.com/JuliaLangEs) (Spanish)
* [JuliaLangPt](https://github.com/JuliaLangPt) (Portuguese)
* [JuliaKorea](https://juliakorea.github.io/ko/) (Korean)

Please let us know if you have another organization dedicated to these efforts.

### Meetups

Julia has local user groups in Europe, North and South America, Asia, and
Australia. Find one near you or start a new one at
[julia.meetup.com](http://julia.meetup.com).
