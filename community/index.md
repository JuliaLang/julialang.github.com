All participants in the Julia community are requested to read the
[Julia Community Standards](standards/), and abide by them in all Julia related
forums.

## Official Channels

### GitHub

We use GitHub for the development of Julia itself.
There we host our source code, track [issues](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues),
and accept [pull requests](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pulls).
We use the issue tracker for bug reports, feature requests, and proposed changes.
For support and questions, please use Discourse.

### Discourse

The primary online discussion venue for Julia is the Discourse forum at
[discourse.julialang.org](https://discourse.julialang.org/).
Discourse is the best place to get fast, high quality answers to Julia questions.
In addition to Q&A, we use Discourse for announcements regarding the language, community,
and events.
There are a variety of categories for domain-specific questions and for package authors
to make their own announcements.

Note that Discourse has taken the place of the old mailing lists, which have been made
read-only.

### Slack

For casual conversation and quick, informal questions, we have an
[official Julia Slack](https://julialang.slack.com).
To join, please visit [slackinvite.julialang.org](https://slackinvite.julialang.org)
to agree to the community code of conduct and receive an invitation.

## Other channels

Julia also has a presence on Stack Overflow under the
[julia-lang](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/julia-lang) tag, and on Stack
Overflow en Espa√±ol under [julia](http://es.stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/julia).

For those who prefer IRC to our official forums, there is a
[#julia channel](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=julia) on Freenode.
We also have an unofficial [Gitter](https://gitter.im/JuliaLang/julia) channel.

## International Community

The Julia community is global, with meetups all over the world and resources in a variety
of different languages.

### Localization

Julia's official documentation is in English, but many groups work to translate and
localize documentation and other resources.
A few such groups that are leading these efforts include:

* [JuliaTokyo](http://julia.tokyo) (Japanese)
* [JuliaCN](https://julialang.cn) (Chinese)
* [JuliaLangEs](https://github.com/JuliaLangEs) (Spanish)
* [JuliaLangPt](https://github.com/JuliaLangPt) (Portuguese)

Please let us know if you have another organization dedicated to these efforts.

### Meetups

Julia has local user groups in Europe, North and South America, Asia, and Australia.
Find one near you or start a new one at [julia.meetup.com](http://julia.meetup.com).
