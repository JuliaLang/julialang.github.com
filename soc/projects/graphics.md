## Makie 1): Improve Documentation + add Examples

[Makie](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Makie.jl) is a new plotting library in need of tests and documentation.

One needs to go through all sections of the current documentation, make sure they are understandable and
add examples to the documentation where necessary.
Depending on how much time is left,
there are endless opportunities to create impressive and creative plotting examples
for the example database.

**Expected Results**: greatly improved documentations
**Recommended skills**: Attention to detail and a lot of experience with plotting.
**Mentors**: [Simon Danisch](https://github.com/SimonDanisch/)


## Makie 2): Develop a Cairo/GR/WebVisualize backend

This project involves overloading the [Makie API](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Makie.jl/tree/master/src/atomics)
for backends to draw all the different plot types.
You will start with a skeleton from already present backends, so it's about filling the
gaps and making sure all tests pass for the new backend.

**Expected Results**: a fully working new backend to Makie
**Recommended skills**: One should be familiar with a graphics drawing API like Cairo or WebGL for this project.
**Mentors**: [Simon Danisch](https://github.com/SimonDanisch/)


## Makie 3): Port Recipes

[Plots.jl](https://github.com/tbreloff/Plots.jl) offers a lot of [recipes](http://docs.juliaplots.org/latest/recipes/).
In Makie, we will need to make sure that they are available and work correctly.
This project will involve writing a compatibility layer for (PlotRecipes.jl)[https://github.com/JuliaPlots/PlotRecipes.jl] and then making sure
that all the recipes that are spread around the Julia plotting community work!
**Expected Results**: porting and testing as many recipes as possible
**Recommended skills**: Experience with Plots.jl would be great
**Mentors**: [Simon Danisch](https://github.com/SimonDanisch/)
