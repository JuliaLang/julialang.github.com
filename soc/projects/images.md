# {{ page.title }}

{% include toc.html %}

[JuliaImages](https://github.com/JuliaImages) has recently undergone a significant revamp, with many improvements in the core infrastructure, project organization, and documentation. For the future, a major push is on expanding the functionality. Please see the [documentation](http://juliaimages.github.io/latest/) for information about the current state; perhaps the [feature comparison matrix](http://juliaimages.github.io/latest/api_comparison.html) may be particularly useful for generating further ideas about possible ways to contribute.

## Interactivity and visualization tools

Image processing often involves tight interaction between algorithms and visualization. While there are a number of older tools available, leveraging GLVisualize seems to hold the greatest promise. This project might implement a number of interactive tools for region-of-interest selection, annotation, measurement, and modification.  Software suites like OpenCV, ImageJ/Fiji, scikit-image, and Matlab might serve as inspiration.

**Recommended skills:** Previous experience developing GUIs.

**Expected Results:** Building blocks for developing custom GUIs for interactive image processing and analysis.  Possible creation of an interactive "shell application" similar to ImageJ.

**Mentors:** [Simon Danisch](https://github.com/SimonDanisch), [Tim Holy](https://github.com/timholy/), and [Ron Rock](https://github.com/rsrock).

## Integration of OpenCV and JuliaImages

OpenCV is one of the pre-eminent image-processing frameworks, and there is an existing [OpenCV wrapper](https://github.com/maxruby/OpenCV.jl). This project would update it for more recent versions of Julia and JuliaImages, convert it into a module, improve interoperability with pure-Julia image processing, and make further refinements to code and documentation. In areas of overlap between pure-Julia and OpenCV functionality, one would also implement a set of benchmarks for performance comparisons.

**Recommended skills:** Previous experience using OpenCV in C++ or one of the bindings for other languages.

**Expected Results:** A rejuvinated OpenCV package that integrates more effectively into the ecosystem of JuliaImages.

**Mentors:** [Maximiliano Suster](https://github.com/maxruby) and [Tim Holy](https://github.com/timholy/).
