title:  Using Julia in the classroom
---

Although still a young language, and a bit rough around the edges, we believe that Julia is ready for the classroom. We encourage instructors to particpate on the [mailing lists](http://julialang.org/community/) for questions regarding the readiness of Julia or specific packages.

# Installing Julia

[Julia binaries](http://julialang.org/downloads/) are available for Mac and Windows. It is also easy to [build from source](http://github.com/juliaLang/julia/) on Linux, Mac, and Windows.

# The Julia manual

The [Julia manual](http://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/) contains a complete introduction to the Julia language, and is available in English and Chinese.

# Julia packages for teaching

Julia [packages](http://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/packages/packagelist/) span a number of disciplines. Some packages are well developed, whereas others are fledgling efforts.

# Videos

We recorded a number of [videos](http://julialang.org/blog/2013/03/julia-tutorial-MIT/) as part of the Julia tutorial at MIT in January 2013. These videos are published in the [Julia channel on Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/user/JuliaLanguage). [Slides](http://beowulf.csail.mit.edu/18.337/index.html) and other material from the tutorial are available on GitHub.

# Classes using Julia

* Homer Reid has put up an excellent [tutorial on basic numerical programming](http://homerreid.ath.cx/teaching/18.330/JuliaProgramming.shtml) in Julia, as part of [MIT 18.330](http://homerreid.ath.cx/teaching/18.330/).

* MIT 18.06 Linear Algebra, taught by Alan Edelman.

* [MIT 18.337](http://beowulf.csail.mit.edu/18.337/index.html), Parallel Computing, taught by Alan Edelman.
