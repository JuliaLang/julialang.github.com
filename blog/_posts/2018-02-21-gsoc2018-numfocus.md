title:  Julia joins NumFOCUS in Google Summer of Code 2018
author: The Julia Summer of Code Organizers
---

The Julia project has participated in summer of code events since 2014, just two
years after the language made its public debut.
In 2014, 2016, and 2017, we participated in [Google Summer of Code][gsoc], and in 2015
we held our own summer of code event.
This year we're doing things a little differently.
As a [NumFOCUS][nf] sponsored project, we're excited to announce that we're participating
in Google Summer of Code 2018 under the NumFOCUS umbrella.
We hope that this will further broaden our reach to potential students and encourage
even greater engagement than in previous years.

For participants, things will look pretty much the same as they did in previous years,
except that students and mentors will be signing up through NumFOCUS.
We encourage interested students to check out our current [project ideas][projects]
and [application guidelines][apply], as well as the [NumFOCUS announcement][nf-ann],
which has more information about participating through NumFOCUS.

We look forward to seeing you this summer.
Happy coding!
